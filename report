Project 1: Text-twist clone report
Xingyu Huang
My project is a Text-twist game running on website.

You can go to https://project1-text-twist.herokuapp.com/ to play it.
If you want to actually run it, you need to upload these files and create a new
repository at Github, then create a Heroku account and linked to your GitHub
account, then create a new app, choose the repository and deploys it.

I worked with myself and I took like 15 hours to finished it.
The 'a-ha' moment was I finally figure out how to get all the words from
database depends on the specific rack. That thing obstructs me like 1 or 2 hours.
I tangle on how to use one query request to get the rack and get all the words.
I try lots of queries but not worked. Then, I finally figure out I don't need to
finished at one request PHP or one query, so I divided into two parts: the first
part is requiring the rack and the second is using the rack to request the words.

I wish I could improve my js programming part. Although I finished the program,
I use lots of stupid ways and make code looks very bloated. I hope I can write
the code more cleanly and beautifully.
I also want to add some CSS to make UI more beautiful, add the scoring system
and save/load system.
I think I need more 5 to 10 hours to finish the imporve.
The overall impression of the experience is very great for me. Because I didn't
write HTML/js/php very long time and it helps me remember something, it can help
me in the future class.
The skill I need to improve still is programming skill.
